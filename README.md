# Hello, I’m Yash

I am a design-savyy software engineer with a passion for web applications and systems programming. I have delivered high-quality solutions over the years for both enterprise as well as product-based startups.

I am currently pursuing a Master's in Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, School of Computer Science.

I have experience with low-level systems programming and have designed compilers before. Currently, I am working on a WebAssembly engine called Wizard, where I am leveraging my skills to advance WebAssembly teaching and research.
