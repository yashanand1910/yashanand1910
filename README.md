# Hello, I’m Yash

I am a seasoned software engineer with a passion for web applications, programming languages and systems with a proven track record of delivering high-quality solutions for both corporates and product-based startups.

I am currently pursuing a Master's in Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, School of Computer Science.

I have experience with functional programming and have built compilers. Currently, I am working on dynamic analysis and instrumentation on a WebAssembly engine called [Wizard](https://github.com/titzer/wizard-engine).
