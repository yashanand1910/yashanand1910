# Hello, I’m Yash

I am a seasoned software engineer with a passion for web applications, programming languages, and systems, backed by a solid track record of delivering top-notch solutions for both corporate organizations and product-based startups.

I am currently pursuing a Master's in Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, School of Computer Science.

I have a strong background in functional programming and compiler development, and I've researched and created tools for dynamic analysis and instrumentation for WebAssembly.
